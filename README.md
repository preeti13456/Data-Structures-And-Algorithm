# Data-Structures-And-Algorithm
This Repository contains all the information and application regarding Data Types and Algorithms with the help of References and code which i will be provided here with help of visualizers and charts.  


Commonly used Data Structures
Let’s first list the most commonly used data structures, and then we’ll cover them one by one:

Arrays
Stacks
Queues
Linked Lists
Trees
Graphs
Tries (they are effectively trees, but it’s still good to call them out separately).
Hash Tables


And the algorithms we are dealing are 
--> Selection Sort
---> Insertion sort
--> Quick sort
